---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B2: Describe your code for traversing a user-specified path.  How
>> do traversals of absolute and relative paths differ?

We begin a path traversal by finding the "base" directory of the path.
For relative paths this is the working directory, and for absolute paths
this is the root directory. Then we loop over each `strtok_r`'d token
in the path -- using '/' -- as our separator. We lookup each token
in our current directory, make sure it's a directory, and then set
that to be our new current directory. If we ever encounter a file
midway through our path traversal we bail out. 

The actual code is split into three functions -- one which finds the
base directory for a path, one which finds the "containing" directory
of a path (aka "/foo/bar/baz" has containing directory "bar") and one
which returns the inode of the target of a full path.

Once we `dir_open` a directory we will acquire its `directory_lock`
which is stored on its inode whenever we need to perform an operation
on the directory. This prevents simultaneous operations on any given
directory.

No. We refuse to remove directory if (1) its inode's open_cnt is greater
than 1 (we open the inode before we remove it, so we cannot check for 
greater than 0) or (2) if there are files/dirs in it.

Condition (1) is violated if any process has the dir open and importantly
each process' working directory is an open dir. So, For each working
directory (1) is violated.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B6: Explain why you chose to represent the current directory of a
>> process the way you did.

By using an actual opened dir to represent the working directory we
make lookups for relative paths very quick since we only need to return
it from the thread struct. Furthermore, since the dir is opened we
prevent anyone from `remove`ing it.

---- RATIONALE ----

Buffer caching is particularly useful for things that touch deep paths
a lot. If, for instance, we want to add files to a dir like /a/b/c/d/e/f
or perform lots of writes and reads in that location then our filesystem
will have to perform a full recursive lookup each time -- which requires
loading the inodes for each directory off disk -- and this is slow. The
buffer cache will probably keep them in memory and make the lookups very
fast. In general if we were to do something like random access into a
file that we open and close a lot then the buffer cache will speed it up
significantly -- for instance, a text editor could benefit.

Read-ahead is helpful for things which do sequential reads. One obvious 
example is a media server on the web. Streaming a video will typically 
require us to read several sequential sectors so read-ahead will 
start reading the next part of the video into memory before we need it.

Write-behind is helpful if we're doing lots of small writes to a file.
For instance, a text editor that implements rapid autosaving would
benefit from write-behind because it would not have to block for 
nearly as long on each write to disk so the autosaving would seem
much more seamless. 


			   SURVEY QUESTIONS

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.
